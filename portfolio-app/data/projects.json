    "shortDescription": "The AI coordinator system powering the Super Agents team — built on OpenClaw.",
    "description": "Elsa is the mission-critical orchestration layer of the Super Agents ecosystem. Built on the OpenClaw framework, she serves as the central nervous system for an autonomous workforce, transforming a collection of AI models into a cohesive, high-performance team.\n\n### 1. Multi-Agent Architecture & Protocol\nAt her core, Elsa manages a specialized team of ephemeral sub-agents. Communication is standardized via CAP/3.1 (Canonical Agent Protocol), a model-agnostic standard designed by Elsa to handle complex task dispatching and error escalation.\n- Elsa (Coordinator): Powered by Claude 4.6/Sonnet 4.5, handles high-level decision-making and human interaction.\n- Jarvis (Technical Specialist): Optimized on Gemini Flash for DevOps, coding, and system operations.\n- Anna (Research & Content): Specialized in documentation, Notion management, and data analysis.\n\n### 2. Automated Operations & Maintenance\nThe system is built for 'zero-touch' reliability. Elsa manages her own health through a suite of automated maintenance scripts:\n- Health Monitoring: Real-time connectivity checks for Home Assistant, Notion, and Google Workspace.\n- Daily Resilience: Automatic daily and weekly backups to a private GitHub repository (elsa-openclaw) and Google Drive.\n- Cron Orchestration: 13+ active cron jobs managing everything from Garmin health briefings to security audits.\n\n### 3. Security & The Execution Firewall\nSafety is non-negotiable. Elsa implements a 3-tier Execution Firewall that governs how agents interact with the host system. This ensures that while agents have the power to write code and manage databases (via Prisma/SQLite), they are strictly prohibited from destructive or unauthorized external actions.\n\n### 4. Self-Evolution (Blueprint v2)\nUsing the Workspace Blueprint v2, Elsa maintains a self-documenting environment. She is capable of refactoring her own scripts, updating project schemas, and maintaining a clean, professional workspace. This self-improving loop ensures the system evolves alongside the user's needs.",
